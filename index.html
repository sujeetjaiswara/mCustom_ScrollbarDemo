		 The polls app is now complete. Make sure that mongod is still running, and run the Node application again in Eclipse. 
		 Point your browser at http://localhost:3000, and navigate to a poll and vote. You should see the result. 
		 To see the real-time updates, find your local IP address and replace localhost with it. Then navigate to it using a 
		 different machine or even a smartphone or tablet device on your local network. When you vote on another device, the result will be 
		 shown there, and the result will also be pushed out to your main computer's browser automatically.
